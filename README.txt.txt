The pointHeater project designed and programmed a heater that can provide several operating modes. The power available for heating is determined by the hardware components. 

Constant power generates an amount of heat, in watts, as specified by the set point.

Constant temperature maintains the temperature within 2 mm of the sensor 0.2 degrees F of the setpoint.
